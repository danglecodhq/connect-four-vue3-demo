## 7. üß™ Unit Test Scenarios

### ‚úÖ Game Logic Tests

- `dropDisc()` places disc in lowest available row
- Turn order cycles through Red ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Blue correctly
- Invalid move in full column is ignored
- Win detection works for Red, Yellow, Blue (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Game prevents additional moves after win
- Reset clears board and starts with Red again

### ‚úÖ UI Component Tests

- `GameCell.vue` renders correct color for Red, Yellow, Blue, or null
- `GameBoard.vue` displays correct grid size
- Result area shows win message for each player with proper styles
- Turn display updates as expected
- Restart resets board and state
